# Single image that serves every network transport of the `code` VGI worker:
#   docker run ... IMG            -> HTTP server on $PORT      (default; Fly.io / local)
#   docker run ... IMG tcp        -> raw Arrow-IPC over TCP on $PORT_TCP
#   docker run -i ... IMG stdio   -> stdio worker DuckDB spawns on-host
# See docker-entrypoint.sh.
#
# Like vgi-units this worker is STATELESS: parsing is powered by tree-sitter
# grammars compiled statically into the binary, so there is no /data volume, no
# model registry, and no `farm.query.vgi.volumes` mount-discovery label. The
# image is just the binary + a tiny entrypoint.
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# ---- build stage -----------------------------------------------------------
# Pinned glibc (bookworm) so the binary links against the same libc the slim
# runtime ships. tree-sitter grammars build via `cc` (a C compiler); the rust
# image already ships gcc, so no extra build deps are needed.

# Copy the whole workspace (manifests + sources + lockfile). The cargo registry
# and target dir are BuildKit cache mounts, so the binary is copied OUT to a
# non-cache path before the layer ends (cache mounts don't persist in the image).
